## About üßê <a name = "about"></a>

PyHAT is more than just a snake with a hat üêçü§†. It stands for Python htmx ASGI Tailwind&mdash;a web stack that allows you to build powerful web applications using nothing more than... drumroll... Python, htmx, and Tailwind.

The following is a curated list of awesome things related to this stack.

## Usage ‚úèÔ∏è <a name = "usage"></a>

Htmx can be used with any backend framework. Currently, there is a lot of experimentation in the Python space, which is exciting! But that also means that there are a lot of disparate approaches.

The best advice here is to get familiar with some of the core packages (htmx, tailwind). Then feel free to check out any of the packages below.

### Official Resources

-   [htmx](https://htmx.org/) - htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext. Htmx has no outside dependencies outside of a vanilla JavaScript file referenced in your HTML `<head>` section.
-   [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. Tailwind provides a standalone CLI tool that _does not_ require npm or any other JavaScript dependencies. (You can install it through `pip` using the [pytailwindcss](https://pypi.org/project/pytailwindcss/) library)

### Introductory Resources

-   [simple site](https://github.com/tataraba/simplesite) - Provides thorough documentation on building a site from the ground up with FastAPI, Jinja, htmx, and Tailwind.
-   [Music Binder](https://github.com/tataraba/musicbinder) - More advanced version of above repo showcasing features like active search and infinite scroll. You can open with a Codespace in GitHub without having to install anything locally.
-   [Rapid Prototyping with Flask, htmx, and Tailwind CSS](https://testdriven.io/blog/flask-htmx-tailwind/) - In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up Flask with htmx and Tailwind CSS. (testdriven.io)


### Introductory Courses

-   [HTMX + Flask: Modern Python Web Apps, Hold the JavaScript Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/htmx-flask-modern-python-web-apps-hold-the-javascript) - htmx is one of the hottest properties üî• in web development today, and for good reason. This framework, along with the libraries and techniques introduced in this course, will have you writing the best Python web apps you've ever written: clean, fast, and interactive without all that frontend overhead.

## Third Party Packages

### Django

-   Forge Packages
Forge is a set of Django packages that work well together, but can also be used independently. These include some htmx/tailwind specific packages highlighted below. Note that these are opinionated approaches, but they provide a robust set of features to enhance your developer experience.
    -   [forge-htmx](https://www.forgepackages.com/docs/forge-htmx/) -  The forge-htmx Django package adds a couple of unique features for working with HTMX. One is template fragments and the other is view actions.
    -   [forge-tailwind](https://www.forgepackages.com/docs/forge-tailwind/) - Use Tailwind CSS with Django without requiring JavaScript or npm.
